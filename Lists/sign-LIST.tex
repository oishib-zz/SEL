%% This file sets up the Sign and Label datatypes and creates Sign and
%% Label macros.
%%
%% Signs generally represent interesting parts of game area, usually
%% as things posted on walls.  Labels represent other things, often on
%% or inside envelopes, that are part of complex mechanics.
%%
%% The default value for \MYloc will inherit location from the Place
%% or Sign most immediately up the ownership tree.  Override this by
%% setting \MYloc to anything (even blank).
%%
%% Sign is for full-sized signs that would cover most of a large
%% manila envelope; SignMedium is for signs sized to half-sized manila
%% envelopes; SignSmall is for signs sized for small manila envelopes
%% (the same size as item cards).  Label, LabelMedium, and LabelSmall
%% are analagous, but they don't have a \takedownby note at the
%% bottom.  You can always use a sign or label without an envelope or
%% with a differently-sized envelope.  Choose which based on
%% visibility and content.
%%
%% SignTiny is for signs you want to be hard to find; it is small and
%% does not have a \takedownby note.  SignDot is for a very small
%% "dot" which only has a title.
%%
%% SignStrip produces a strip of paper (without a \takedownby note)
%% with labels on the outside that show on both sides if you fold it
%% in half.  These are a convenient alternative to sub-envelopes. They
%% can also be used for "s-packets" taped to walls (see
%% Extras/README-s-packets).
%%
%% LabelCover ces a label similar to the cover to a research
%% notebook.  LabelPage, likewise, produces a page.
%%
%% EOG is for full-sized end-of-game signs.

  \s\MYtext	{Here sits the queen of the pixies, a blue wizened creature the size of a human fist. She does not produce pixie dust any longer. Instead, she sits on a throne of physical objects that her subjects have collected at some point. If you spend thirty seconds complimenting her, she will permit you to examine her throne.
  
  To examine the throne, look through the items in the envelope below. This process only represents looking at the items. If an item is itself represented by an envelope, do not look inside that envelope-- you do not experience any touch-based magical effects from the throne's items.
  
  If the throne strikes your fancy, the queen will allow you to take a single item with you. If you take an item represented by an envelope, you must now open the envelope and be affected by any touch-based effects.
  
  You may not add items to the queen's throne.}
