Liches may carry up to five items at a time in their clothing. When an item is in your clothing, you are not touching it, so touch effects are not triggered unless you try to remove it. 

Whenever you touch a non-food item you should look inside the corresponding envelope to see if you undergo any magical effects. Non-food items cannot be destroyed unless you know otherwise.

You may destroy a food item by eating it. If you eat it, destroy the item card. Food items never have magical effects on them.

You cannot tamper with items unless you know otherwise.

You own only the items you are carrying at start of game. Whenever you touch a magical item you own you may choose whether to ignore its magical effect or not.

Besides pixie dust deposits, no two items are identical. This is a kludge.
