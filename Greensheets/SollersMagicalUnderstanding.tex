You have a Magical Understanding score. Your score starts off at 1, but as you observe feats of lich magic you learn more about spellcasting and increase your score.

Every time you perform a spell that you did not know how to perform at the start of the convention, your score increases by 2.

The first time you notice a particular lich's aura changing because they are casting a spell, your score increases by 1.
