Unless you know otherwise, all your spells emit a noticeable aura. You must declare "I am casting a spell" as out-of-game information whenever you cast a spell. Do not specify what spell you are casting unless instructed.

Liches frequently carry magically booby-trapped items in order to deter pickpockets.

Magical items are not power sources unless specifically labeled that way.

If you are under multiple conflicting magical compulsions, spell effects supersede the effects of magical items. Mind control effects supersede all other types of effects. If you are under competing effects from the same sort of source (e.g. one spell tells you to holler at the top of your lungs while another tells you to be silent), the effect that began most recently takes precedence.

Some magic users can imbue items with magical qualities, brew potions, and make magical machines. These processes require large amounts of sophisticated equipment that is unavailable in-game. Such items generally are rare and pricey.

You can only cast spells if conscious.

Spells and other magical effects have no impact on dead people. If you die, all magical effects acting on you immediately cease.
