You have a Magical Understanding score. Your score starts off at 1, but as you observe feats of lich magic you learn more about spellcasting and increase your score.

Every time you perform a spell that you did not know how to perform at the start of the convention, your score increases by 2.

The first time you notice a particular lich's aura changing because they are casting a spell, your score increases by 1.

If your score reaches 7, you can transform into a lich! At any point in the rest of your life, if you have your prepared blue pen in your hand or on your person, you can choose to become a lich. When you choose to become a lich, take a card from the Phylactery packet, write your current power level on it, and put the card in your blue pen. Let a GM know that you have become a lich.
